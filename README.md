## Installation

This project utilizes Python 3 and default packages for data visualization and prediction for most of the analysis.

The additional packages are plotly and orca.

## Project Motivation

This project, covers the following three questions using Seattle Airbnb data:

  1. What are the distribution of listing prices by neighborhoods?
  2. How does the property type impact listing price on a neighborhood?
  3. How well can we predict listing price?

## Files Description

There is one notebook available here to address the questions above.
This notebook can be visualzed via NBViewer.

Auxiliary scripts are found under src/ directory.

The input data (listings_detailed.csv) is under the inp/ directory.
This file was downloaded from Kaggle.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.
